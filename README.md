# pypathutil

Command line utilities to help you work with paths.

## What is it for ?

have you even done calculations of paths in shells of the form:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

And did you get upset when the path came out wrong? either repeated
elements, extra colons, wrong order and the like?

This is the end of your troubles.

## Examples

    $ sdfds
    $ sdfad
